CEGO Patch Notes 

Version 2.0.0 @ 2015-10-06
	- General remark: This update includes some changes that are not backwards compatible.
		E.g., Several of the main function interfaces changed,
		to make functions more usable/flexible/understandable. See details below.  
		- Deprecated distancePermutationLCSeq. Replaced by distancePermutationInsert to stress edit-distance character of the function,
			for better readability and to avoid confusion of LCSeq and LCStr. The deprecated distancePermutationLCSeq will be removed in the next patch.
		- Variable names in optimInterface changed
		- Unified the interfaces of all optim* functions in the package. Now all take x, fun and control as input. creationFunction is part of control now.
		- Unfied interface for distance based landscape generators, landscapes now expect list of solutions as input. (i.e., even a single solution has to be wrapped into a list)
		- Renamed all modeling functions and the corresponding objects, e.g., combinatorialKriging is now modelKriging (old functions are deprecated and will be removed in next update).
  - Moved from .C to .Call interface for several permutation distance measures. 
    This may speed up distance calculation quite significantly in some cases:
    E.g., distancePermutationInterchange and distancePermutationInsert (formerly LCSeq) are now 
    ~3 times faster for typical test cases. Some distance measures that do not rely on 
    C code (e.g., Hamming, Euclidean) are not affected by this change.  
	- Added pivoting to Cholesky decomposition in likelihood estimation
		function for modelKriging. Allows for PSD correlation matrices.
	- New "control" parameter in modelKriging: control$scaling. 
    When this is set to TRUE, the distance matrix is divided by the 
    maximum distance to yield values between 0 and 1. This allows to 
    avoid scaling bias when distance functions may yield values larger 
		than one.
  - Improved documentation for several functions
	- Bugfix for the weighted tardiness benchmark, weight vector now handled correctly
  - New mutation operator for permutations (reversal mutation): mutationPermutationReversal 
  - Keeping an archive of candidate solutions in the EA is now optional. See the control parameter "archive" in optimEA.
 	- Custom choices for duplicate removal are now in optimEA. See control parameters "duplicateFunction" and "duplicateRemoval".
  - In case model building fails during a run of optimCEGO, the run stops (with a warning), giving the result so far as well as a termination message.
	
	- TODO: default Brent optim for one-dim kriging case?
